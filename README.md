## About

**LOCALLY** is an immersive AR/VR experience designed to help you see a city through its soul.

Whether it's a humble plate of poha, a street-side kulfi cart, or the sound of someone saying "hao", Locally turns everyday sights into cultural stories — all with a scan.

Just point your camera, and the scanned object springs to life as a glowing 3D hologram surrounded by bite-sized info, voice notes, and fun facts. It’s part encyclopedia, part street tour, part nostalgia — all in the palm of your hand.

🌆 Built for curious hearts and wandering feet, Locally helps young explorers connect with unfamiliar cities through hyperlocal elements — language, food, objects, and slang — in the most interactive way possible.

So next time you wonder:
"What's this?"
Just scan it.
Let Locally show you what makes it local.
